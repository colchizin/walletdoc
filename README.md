Simple, Lightweight Expense Documentation for your Wallet

Introduction
============

Walletdoc (short for Wallet Documentation) is a simple and lightweight
tool for documenting the state of your Wallet (i.e. your cash expenses).
It is aimed at people who do their regular accounting on thei Home PC
(e.g. with GNUCash) but who's memory is too bad to remember all the cash
expenses made during the day.

With this app you can simply add a new expense (a withdrawl of cash from
your wallet) or a new revenue (you put cash into your wallet) by clicking
on button and are presented with a simple user interface. After having
added an expense/revenue you are provided with a list of all of your
expenses/revenues and the balance of your wallet.

This Software is NOT intended as a complete accounting software and will
never become one.
